# Error-code-correction-ECC-using-verilog-Hamming-code
This project implements a **Hamming (12,8)** Error Detection and Correction system in Verilog, supporting **single-bit correction**, **word parity error detection**, and **multi-bit error reporting**.

## üîç Overview
Hamming codes are a type of **block code** that can detect and correct **single-bit errors** in data transmission or memory. This project adds a 1-bit **word parity** to further enhance reliability.

The Hamming (12,8) code uses:
- 8 data bits  
- 4 parity bits (P1, P2, P4, P8)  
- 1 word parity bit (overall parity over 12 bits)
‚û°Ô∏è **Total = 13-bit encoded word**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Working of Error Correction Code

1. Syndrome Calculation:  
   - Each parity bit checks a specific group of data and parity bits.
   - A 4-bit `syndrome` is generated by re-checking parity conditions.
   - If syndrome ‚â† 0 ‚Üí bit at that position error exists.

2. Word Parity:
   - Additional overall parity bit at MSB position.
   - Used to distinguish between **word parity error** and **multi-bit error** when syndrome = 0.

3. Error Classification:

| Syndrome | Word Parity | Interpretation         | Action                 |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| `0000`   | Even        | No Error               | Accept as-it-is        |
| `0000`   | Odd         | Word Parity Error      | correct the bit        |
| ‚â†`0000`  | Odd         | Single-bit Error       | Correct the bit        |
| ‚â†`0000`  | Even        | Multi-bit Error        | Uncorrectable          |
